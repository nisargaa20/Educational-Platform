# Educational-Platform
Enlighten Minds that empowers students to personalize their learning journey and unlock their full potential with the guidance of experienced mentors. It was built by using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the website's structure, style the content, and implement interactive functionalities. We incorporated the Font Awesome CDN for appealing icons and the Google Fonts CDN for the Nunito font family to enhance the visual appeal and readability of the content.
